Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was Liam the owner of DriverPass who noticed lots of failing scores from the local DMV. He wanted to design a system where students/users can sign into their
cloud-based website and access their account. Where they can access learning tools, tests, scores, and be able to make appointments for online tests or in person driving]
lessons. His goal is to help people get higher scores and learn the rules of the road better.
What did you do particularly well?
What I did particularly well was listening to the clients needs and applying them to every part of the system. Constantly reviewing the clients needs helped me better 
understand what exactly the client needed. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to revise the security part of my document and include more ways to create a safe and secure website. Requiring the website to have a CA making the website 
secure and implementing encryption throughout it so that the data will not be breached easily.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreting the users needs by listening to every requirement that he had requested for his system and use it. I made sure to not leave out any important details that he had
requested because I wanted out client to have a system that he asked for and make him happy. Being able to apply every detail he had asked for in my design benefits the client
as well as our company being able to bring back our client when he may need help on new projects and refer us to others. It is so important to consider the user's needs for 
the exact reasons that I had just stated above. A happy client creates good reviews, more customers, and satisfied relationships.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing a software by constantly reviewing the clients wishes. Interpreting and considering the clients needs is what makes the software perfect. You cannot create
a software that the client does not want or doesn't contain what they asked. Techniques and strategies I would use in the future to analyze a system design is to make my own
list of what the client wants from the start and be able to use that as a guideline throughout the entire building process.
